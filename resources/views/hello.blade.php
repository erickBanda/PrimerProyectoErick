    <h1>Hello, Laravel</h1>
    <h2>
        We are Charlie Kirk, we carry the flame
We'll fight for the Gospel, we'll honor his name
We are Charlie Kirk, his courage our own
Together unbroken, we'll make Heaven known
A husband, a father, his family held near
A home built on Scripture, on faith without fear
The world tried to silence, but his voice remains
In us it echoes, in Christ it sustains
We are Charlie Kirk, we carry the flame
We'll fight for the Gospel, we'll honor his name
We are Charlie Kirk, his courage our own
Together unbroken, we'll make Heaven known
The battle is raging, the darkness will fall
We rise with his spirit, we answer the call
The truth is eternal, the Cross is our guide
With God as our Captain, we march side by side
We are Charlie Kirk, we carry the flame
We'll fight for the Gospel, we'll honor his name
We are Charlie Kirk, his courage our own
Together unbroken, we'll make Heaven known
We are Charlie Kirk
Forever alive
We are Charlie Kirk
With God we will rise
    </h2>
